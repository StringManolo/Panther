Panther is a privacy-focused Android browser based on WebView.  
  

### Features
- Console support
  - Add a console to view the console.log in Android, run commands, etc
<br>  
  
- Basic Browser Functionality
<br>

- Hardcoded User-Agent by default:
  - User-Agents typically reveal your operating system and browser version to every website you visit.
  - Even browsers like Tor Browser do not fully address this issue. When they do, they only overwrite the HTTP headers to fake it.
  - Panther overwrites the `navigator.userAgent` property to protect you from JavaScript fingerprinting attacks.
  - This enhances your privacy and security, protecting you from automated web exploit kits.
  - Default User-Agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 14) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.6478.122 Mobile Safari/537.36"
<br>

- Allows Zoom In/Out even when webpages try to disable it
