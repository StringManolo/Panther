- Try to Hijack DNS (to allow user to override system default DNS servers)
- Allow user to configure the use of Cache
- Allow user to configure the use of localstorage
- Allow user to set default search engine
- Add more search engines from userlookup?
- Allow to change default webpage
- Add new privacy overrides (like battery status) This seems very hard to do.
- Allow to use System's Tor Proxy
